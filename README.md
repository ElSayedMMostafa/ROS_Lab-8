# ROS_Lab-8
The requirement for Lab#8 for CIE-408 course.
A simulation for visulaizing the data of an ultrsonic sensor using RVIZ.
 - The created publisher node "simulate_node" mimics the ultrsonic sensor and publishes ultrasonic ranges data as an outout.
* Due to something wrong, RVIZ coudlnot visualize the Range outputs although the setup is correct. Hence, I added markers to visulaize them instead of the Range. 
  A marker (green sphere) is located at the distance created by the ultrasonic simulator node (simulate_node).
